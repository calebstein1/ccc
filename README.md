# Caleb's Crappy Console

Caleb's Crappy Console is a new fantasy console under heavy development and coming soon.

Unlike other fantasy consoles that aim to be easy to use by running languages like Lua, this console runs it's own custom virtual 8-bit CPU that's somewhat reminiscent of the 6502.
There's currently no documentation on its machine code or assembly language, though obviously that'll change as the project moves along.
Ultimately, it would be nice to properly implement the 6502 instruction set in this thing, that way you'd be able to write software for it using, for example, the cc65 toolchain.
We'll call it a stretch goal ðŸ¤·

## Status by project

#### CCC (Caleb's Crappy Console)

Builds and runs, currently working towards getting all opcodes implemented.

#### CCA (Caleb's Crappy Assembler)

Exceedingly crappy.

This is the result of about an hour of work because I got tired of raw-dogging hexadecimal into binary files to test the console.
It will turn .asm files into CCC machine code and that's it.
No fancy features, but it makes testing easier for now.
In the end, it will get a ground-up rewrite, or I'll just implement 6502 properly and not have to worry about this wierd custom assembler.

Right now, CCC assembly is a very limited subset of 6502 assembly.
Not every opcode is implemented yet, and only absolute addressing is supported at this point, for example.
Any CCC assembly code should run on a proper 6502, but any proper 6502 assembly won't run on CCC yet.
